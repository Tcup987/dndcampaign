After finishing up a previous job, Xavier found their way to the same inn, however any relaxing evening was interrupted by an undead attack on the town, which was fended off by K, Xavier, Pyrrha, and the town guard, but not without losses. Further investigation on the seeming leader of the attack, a faceless undead, yeilded a silver coin found on its person, an insignia of the Church of Death from the city of Riverseed on its face. Before heading back, Pyrrha noticed a cloaked figure on the edge of the woods, with red eyes shinning against the black backdrop. After a nights rest, the three found Gale attempting to calm down an agitate crowd, seeking answers and safety. After Xavier offered to venture into the woods to find the root of the undead issue, Pyrrha and K volunteered to go with, and upon collecting some supplies ventured off, making their way into the woods. Encountering a seeming scout of this presence and following in its direction of travel, and almost dying crossing a river, the three set up camp 20ish miles south of a large fog cloud covering a large swath of the the woods. K taking the first watch was distracted, and thus did not notice the 3 faceless ones that descended on the camp. However, Pyrrhas senses noticed just before they attacked Xavier, unleashing a turn undead and sending one of them running, leaving two left standing over the party."

They fled and hid within the woods, realizing some new truths about each other, and after a moderately tense discussion, Kaia divulged their true identity, mentioning an ancient people known as the Seraphids. Upon coming to an understanding, they ventured towards the fog cloud, entering it following small lights that seemed to float in the mist. Upon entering the mist, they were surrounded by more of these lights, which led them away towards the north of the fog cloud, at which time they attempted to kill the party by leading them off a cliff, however, the party successfully fended them off by Pyrrha’s clerical proficiency combined with Xavier’s telepathic abilities. After fighting them off, the party stealthily made their way towards the central ruins, following the black veins in the ground and avoiding the prowling undead in the fog. The party made their way to the tower at the center of it all, seeing red light emitting from the top of the tower and a rickety drawbridge leading to it across a moat of black ichor."

The party found a variety of items, including a tiny scythe called a Death Scythe, which communicated with Pyrrha after attunement, asking her to return the scythe to Anntie Annie near Atharnac. The party returned to Kamtor, seeing the undead presence diminished within the woods, their task completed, and discussed next steps, deciding to stick together in shared interest and curiosity. As they arrived, the town under siege from a group of raiders, whom the party helped fend off and deal with the fire they set to the crops.

Meeting with Doomguide Haven, they had a tense discussion and learned about the previous peoples of the temple and the root of the coins the party had found. Further, Kaia made a request to help a friend trapped in her journal, and in exchange gave Haven information about her people, the Seraguine, immortal remnants of the ancient Seraphid people. Haven agreed to help with the blessing of a body to transfer the souls into it, however she said that Kaia must find her the body to be used in the ritual with a very specific set of parameters for a viable body. After this discussion, they went shopping, and met a few interesting characters while purchasing a crowbar and bartered for other magical items. Later, Pyrrha attuned to the scythe that she had found in Cynthia’s possession, communing with Auntie Annie in an attempt to learn more about this mysterious figure.

Along the journey they met a manner of interesting folk, including a band of children who attempted to rob the party unsuccessfully. However, each night on the road Pyrrha noticed a strange cart showing up at the same time each night, pulled by a brown horse and driven by a cloaked figure carrying a lantern, the cart was covered by a brown tarp. After finding a hand that fell out of the cart, the party ambushed the cart to learn what was going on, finding the driver to be nothing but a cloak, and the cart to be filled with body parts, some skeletal remains, most human, and some animal."

Pyrrha also noticed 3 figures appear along the coastline before quickly moving away, one headed south, one north, and one directly towards the camp. The party then spoke with General Vivian, who told them that Velgorath had been taken recently by the empire and couldn’t promise passage to the Empire's mainland, but was willing to help as she could with the mission to Atharnac. After passing on that there may be an incursion into the camp and the bodies being brought along the path, the party began helping out where they could, speaking with Dr. Frygg, an automaton doctor who had Pyrrha help with the most wounded while Kaia helped brew healing elixirs for patients. Just as they were finishing up, Xavier was attack by one of the cloaked figures, attempting to take him with them to a man named Gorvan Hollow, which was foiled. However, they said they would be back and escaped into the night, and Vivian appointed guards to watch over the party as they slept, now being people on interest not just to the Empire, but to the Republic as well."

Frygg seemed interested in Xavier’s condition and the reason Gorvan Hollow was after him, where Xavier revealed he has a crystal in his head. Frygg examined Xavier and told him that the crystal was made up of a substance called Astron, a powerful magical essence with the power to give Xavier his powers and Frygg his sentience. Xavier and Pyrrha then discussed the plan with General Vivian, confirming to leave the following day on the Rising Dawn before going about gathering intel and some materials. Kaia went to speak with Head Forger Nadar, who excitedly worked with Kaia during the entire day to help her learn to forge and make modifications to her armor, offering Kaia an apprenticeship for when she was ready. The party then gathered together, rested well, and left on the Rising Dawn the next day, meeting the group accompanying them on their journey, including Sagard, a wizard who Xavier had met earlier the previous day.

The party and their new companions trekked towards Atharnac, finding only a mile large crater in the ground where the city once stood, the hut of Auntie Annie located in the middle of a legion of imperial forces. Without time to plan as after being discovered by one of Annie's abominations, the party was escorted to the hut meeting Annie in all her horror, entering and quickly deciding to end this foe. The battle was tough, losing both Sagard and Wymar to the fight and dropping Pyrrha while Landlyn held the door against the legion outside, but in the end the party was successful in killing the death hag.

Upon further investigation, they learned he was running from the empire and that the ship was likely destroyed by Annie before she was vanquished, and learned that Wymar, Landlyn and Sagard were part of a secondary mission to Darsentine, the Empires capital. Landlyn left to go complete his mission while the party, now with a new acquaintance, ventured south around the long end of the continent making their way back to the Republic.

Later that evening, Pyrrha contacted Haven to no avail and found that Kaia had been contacted by Doomguide Mourngaze. After giving their location, she came and swept the party away back to Riverseed, informing them that Haven had gone missing into the Wastes searching for the seraguine, getting Kaia to help find her in the dune sea. The party left for Morthan and the following morning ventured into the wastes towards Khal’Sinar, a temple Seraphid city Haven was headed towards.

Continuing deeper the party found themselves in an obsidian mirror room with a strange mirror in the center. After pressing the plates around the mirror, they were sucked into another room with floating orbs, each of member facing moments from their past, some more distant than others, confronting them with strength of will and acceptance. When released from the mirror, the big doors leading to the next hidden room opened, however, before they could enter, they were ambushed by Darhek’Korashak and the remain vampire spawn. The party fought hard, nearly dying a few times before rushing into the next room aided by doomguide Mourngaze, who closed the door and sealed it from the outside, leaving them all in the new hidden room.

After resting and recuperating once more, the party set out to get to the body, finding Mournegaze crucified to the scales of Kelemvor in the Great Hall of the temple, and Korashak stood below, now rushing forward to kill Kaia and the band."

While attempting to master her hobbling snake-oil selling persona, Kaia noticed light over the hill ahead, going ahead to scout finding a group of imperial soldiers camping by the side of the road, with them a golden masked mage of the Magisterium Academy. As the party attempted to pass, they were stopped and questioned about people escaping from Volkar’s Gate. After a less than successful attempt to deceive the guards, a fight broke out as Landyn launched an axe at the nearest guards head. After a loud, bright, and explosive fight, the party killed the guards and collected their goods, deciding that the robes and weapons of these guards may be to their advantage, taking on their identities including the mage of the Magisterium. Collecting the bodies and burning them with the cart, releasing the horse and redressing in their new robes, the party bedded down for the night. In the early hours of the morning, the party was attacked by an unseen attacker which sucked life out of Kaia before going after the rest of the party after encountering Pyrrha’s scythe, and once dealt with dropped a note that simply said “Well Done” in familiar, green filigree."

        "details": "The party ventured into Darsentine disguised as the imperial soldiers and mage they encountered and killed along the road to the city, blending in with the other imperial guards and sneaking Pyrrha in in the bag of holding. After getting through, a young man from the magisterium came to fetch Xavier disguised as Trent Burgess, requesting his presence for an audience with Arcanist Vestal. Deciding to deal with him instead of following, Pyrrha quickly dispatched him and shoved the body in the bag of holding, Landlyn moving the party away to his old hideout in the city, unfortunately dispatching some witnesses as they saw the party enter the old building with powers the party had not witnessed before. After being confronted, Landlyn confessed that he gained the powers from the unknown patron C.D. Kaia, both on the road and again in the abandoned warehouse, connected with the astron gem found in the staff Trent was carrying, tapping into a web of power that seemed to originate 2 miles beneath the volcano of Darsentine, noticing that the glowing origin was actually hundreds of moving lights, and noticed that Xavier was separated from this network. After getting snapped out of it by Drayden, the party decided to infiltrate the Factorum Automata, the factory that Landlyn had been previously captured in and one of Gorvan Hollow’s workshops. Infiltrating the facility, the group found a factory churning out hundreds of robots, and while hiding overheard Gorvan Hollow, Empress Kor, and Consular Migate discussing hidden allies and a time scale of a major event as well as inhibitor chips placed within the new robots. However as they continued the conversation out of earshot, the party moved towards Gorvans office, where they found blueprints and tomes that discussed the designs of the many robots in the facility, but before they could leave, Gorvan caught them in the act, sending his massive automated robots in the office after them and a fight ensued. The group was not able to down Gorvan before he teleported away, and as a last ditch effort Kaia launched the bomb they had gotten from Hickory Dickery many moons ago, unleashing a wave of destruction that blew the facility to smithereens, killing Gorvan and downing many members of the party. As they attempted to escape, just as things seemed lost as Drayden and Landlyn were surrounded by falling debris and hundreds of damaged robots, They were teleported to a park in the city, a small pond standing between them and a black cloaked figure with a sigil of the Magisterium Academy emblazoned on his shoulders, who greeted them, introducing himself as the shadow that had been following them, Cevan Detrunco."

        "details": "After a close encounter with death, the party was transported to a garden where they met Cevan Detrunco, the wizard that had been watching over them. After a brief introduction, they followed him into a study room through a portal, where they met a new ally in the form of a speedy barn owlin. Cevan told them that he had assembled them to deal with a threat to the empire and possibly the world, the elder brain and its mindflayer colony below the volcano. Cevan said that he was not able to deal with the threat himself due to the magical protections of the colony as well as needing to deal with the high level colluders on the city simultaneously due to the hive minded nature of the threat. After some questioning, he allowed everyone to discuss over a meal, where introductions were made and a drunk fight ensued, however, the food had been drugged and many of the party fell unconscious, and after a couple attempted sleeps on the remaining few Drayden was the last standing, whom Cevan convinced to go to sleep with the rest of his companions, promising no harm would come to them while they rest. The party awoke in a coliseum on the astral plane, where they were tasked to fight a massive purple worm as a final test before their task. After successfully handling the worm and its minions, Cevan applauded them and returned them to the room they had fallen asleep in, offering help and gifts with the promise of helping with this threat. Many of the party took the offer, gaining additional abilities and after a tense exchange between Pyrrha and Drayden, many found rest while Pyrrha learned what she really signed up for when making a deal with Lady Loss, and Kaia privately asked for Cevans aid."

        "details": "Upon finding rest in Cevan’s tower, Pyrrha was haunted by dreams and premonitions of the day to come, and upon rising spoke with Kaia, worrying about the mission and what might become of the group. Heading to eat, Cevan showed Kaia his workshop, where he and Kaia worked for the day while others learned and trained, building a new body for Roc using the now isolated astron as a magical powersource while discussing the past. That evening the party made merry for the last time before setting out on their mission, drinking to their heart's content and making amends before bedding down, some more gracefully than others. The following day they said their goodbyes to Landlyn and Cevan and were portaled just outside of the mines, Landlyn giving Drayden a farewell embrace before pushing him through. The party then, deciding to attempt a distraction to climb a rope into the mines by having Avrow fly by making eagle calls which was initially successful before another guard noticed the party. Now aware they had been caught, the party changed tactics and ran inside of the mines doors, the guard unable to land a hit on Avrow as he snuck in and Pyrrha slammed the door closed, Kaia welding it shut from the inside."

        "details": "Leaving the guards behind and sealing the door shut, the party continued into the astron mine below Darsentine, coming upon an astron refinery with large chemical vats. Avrow traveled up the ventilation shaft to untie the rope he previously attached and left behind caltrops at the entrances to the vent. As the party continued, they came across a lift system to get deeper into the mines, discovering a locked chest that exploded and attacked Kaia, but was quickly dealt with by the group. Following a passage to a heavy iron door, and after getting blasted with fire, the group investigated what appeared to be Gorvans old laboratory, finding the bodies of Tria and Squall on the ground outside of broken vats, the unconscious body of Argus still suspended in liquid in the third. Xavier, drawn towards a room in the laboratory by memory found the location of his modification, reliving the horror that Gorvan put him through, blood still coating many of the surfaces in the room. Just as the party was leaving, Pyrrha encountered another vat in a back room, this one broken from the interior and noticing chains that appeared to have suspended a large object, in addition to a teleportation circle in the corner, realizing Gorvan may still be a threat. Continuing down into the mines, the party rode the lift and rode the “rollercoaster” in a minecart, finding inactive automatons along the first shaft. Then traveling down further, the party encountered a wider cavern, fighting large automatons in front of a massive astron deposit that drew pyrrha to it, Shar calling to her to keep her end of the bargain. Upon defeating the mining bots, the cavern collapsing around them, Pyrrha gave Kaia the scythe she carried, pushing the party to continue on as she sealed herself behind in the room, and helplessly the party watched as Pyrrha touched the Astron deposit, turning it  and the veins a dark purple as her body turn black and evaporated into dust and the cavern caved in around her."

        "details": "After losing Pyrrha to the large Astron deposit and the cavern collapsing behind them, the party, now one member less, trudged down through the winding passages of the dormant volcano, followed by mindless orcs but able to avoid detection with the help of Avrow’s stealth prowess. After resting for a moment where Kaia discovered that Pyrrha’s scythe was still attached to her, the party continued and found an anti chamber filled with humanoid sized eggs, inside of which they found mind flayers in a variety of stages of development. Dropping down, they killed the orcs tending to the eggs before finding the residence of the elder brain. As the party planned, and after some poor stealth moves by drayden, they were discovered, and a fight ensued. After a long, arduous and taxing battle, the party came out on top, killing the elder brain and all but one of the mind flayers, who escaped by planar travel. As they took in the feat they had accomplished, they heard a rumble down the passage, and very quickly found themselves in front of Gorvan Hollow, now nothing more than a brain in a mechanical suit, and his automatons, now flooding the cavern as Kaia desperately calls for help from Cevan, behind them a portal the the Shadowfell now developing in the place of the Astral Rift."

        "details": "The party, now confronted by Gorvan Hollow and several automatons that made it into the mines, after defeating the elderbrain were able to kill Gorvan once and for all, freeing the automatons which had been under his influence. Cevan teleported down, noticing that the group had successfully handled the threat, and congratulated them on their accomplishment while simultaneously burning what was left of the mindflayer spawn. After conversing the party returned to Grovan’s old lab where with the help of Cevan Kaia was able to free Argus from his glass container, still alive and breathing although now looking worse for wear. Cevan then gifted Xavier and Orb to contact his mother and gave Avrow a compass which pointed him towards the item he lost, who opted to follow Cevan as he left to his demiplane for help in determining his next step. The rest of the party convened and escaped the mines through the front in the chaos of the coup happening outside, finding Landlyn waiting for them. Recollecting where they first hid in Darsentine, Xavier used Cevan’s gift and communicated with his mother, learning that she had suddenly been shunted to the Shadowfell in the events of last night. Hoping to save her, Xavier said his farewells and left to return to the portal, where he found Avrow who was trying to track down his lost treasure, and the two of them jumped into the Shadowfell together. Kaia and Drayden, now intrigued by the silence that had fallen over the city, went to investigate a congregation at remnants of the imperial palace, finding that the new Emperor Kas had collected the betrayers and was directing the people of the city to stone them to death for their actions. Drayden stood forward and convinced them that they should be put on trial, reminding them of what the empire once was. After a conversation with Cevan regarding the changes in the empire behind the coronation ceremony, Kaia left Drayden, Landlyn, and Argus behind to deal with the empire and moved quickly towards her people in the Wastes, arriving to find that the Seraguine and the Doomguides were already fighting. She offered her people a chance to be cured and threatened the doomguides with an Astron bomb if they touched the Seraguine, fending them off and descending into Khal’Sinar to restore her people to their former glory."

Xavier and Avrow, drawn by the light given off by Myrtles torch, followed into the village, taking in the first two people they had seen in a long time, and ones that didn’t seem to belong in the Shadowfell either. Upon conversing, the new group was jumped by several undead which they fended off and ran away, knowing the fight attracted unwanted attention. After a bit of discussion and a tense understanding, the group decided to stick together, heading south following Avrow’s compass and finding the town of Ygdrassil, a protected area by Wisty’s patron, the Raven Queen. Meeting with the Shadar-kai protecting the town, they ventured in and found the Sloppy Inn maintained by Blob, a non-humanoid creature of some kind running the establishment. After a good meal, a trip the the bathhouse, and questioning Blob for more information about this new place they find themselves, Xavier attempted to contact his mother, realizing he was quite close and promising to find her the following day before noticing a red light, similar to the one he had seen back at the village they had left behind, descend onto her group and a red leathery wing came into view before the connection cut."

The party rested uneasily, some given visions of their goals and other crying themselves to sleep, but woke the following morning and formed a plan to collect supplies and information. Myrtle and Wisty went shopping and found an interesting shop called the shadowstep where they bartered their services to collect strange items in exchange for a discount on a few magical trinkets while looking for nicer clothing, while Xavier and Avrow went to speak with Lenoa about the terrain and what to expect beyond the walls, acquiring a map of the local area. After reconvening, they set out southeast towards a rocky outcropping they anticipated to find Xavier’s mother. Stealthy traversing this inhospitable plane, they came to the place Xavier saw in his orb, only finding a set of footprints, one belonging to a hunter and the other to the hunted. They were suddenly jumped by strange shadow creatures which Xavier finished quickly, then escaped into a hidden rock cave following a pair of barefoot tracks, discovering a cold layer and a roper that realized it bit off more than it could chew. They found Xavier’s mother hanging in the ceiling, however the party was not convinced and after trying to persuade the party, The creature transformed into a massive foul beast with chitinous armor and cold breath. The party fended off this creature and killed it in a blaze of glory, unsure of their next steps, whether to venture farther into the cave system or to turn back, dealing with the threats that now lurk outside of the cave entrance."

Avrow, with his keen senses, noticed that they were being watched, following a pair of yellow eyes and shaggy white hair down the tunnel that they saw the roper disappear down. Entering the small tunnel they found their way into a collection of sorts, containing gold, some magic items, and bottles. While searching through the pile, they found the person hiding behind some gold, frightening them and Xavier dealt with the being quickly, realizing that the figure was likely one of the escaped prisoners from the group traveling with Xavier’s mom, finding a tattoo on his arm. After being attacked by the roper that escaped previously, they decided they were not prepared to continue on quite yet and rest in the cavern, continuing towards the coast in the morning. Along the way they saw a massive nightwalker headed West and decided not to engage, eventually making their way to the coast where they encountered a traveling group of shadar-kai. But before they were able to make themselves known, the traveling group was attacked by a horrible monster known as a Devourer, the party fighting it off but not without casualties to the traveling company. After speaking with Prance, the physician leading the group, who let them know they were traveling to Duskwood, they decided to travel with them and protect them along the rest of the journey, arriving in Duskwood and passing through its illusory veil, making their way towards the town center."
